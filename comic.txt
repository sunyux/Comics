[a]Please note Camilo's amazing work with formatting!! If you add more entries, try to follow. I think titles match better and spaces between delimiters have been removed. I think we should try to duplicate some made up entries that have the same superhero name, so we can get plenty of appropriate clustering. Although I am seeing plenty of opportunity for that with this massive file we've put together :)
